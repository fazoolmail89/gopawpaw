---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.0.10 Released 11/15/2002
       * Fixed data editing of sorted rows in the result set.  Which is
         not as easy as it may sound.

3.0.9 Released 10/21/2002
      * Added size to the column data panel.
      * Fixed XML Export

3.0.8 Released 09/19/2002
      * Made connector menu listen to properties so there is no 
        need to restart after adding new drivers via the driver loader
	properties.
      * Fixed PostgreSQL connector frame to remember previous connect.
      * Fixed result set popup window which had insert/update/delete
        disabled regardless of the canEdit property.

3.0.7 Unreleased
      * Fixed history.  New elements were not being added to the list.
      * Made generic connector row toolbar unfloatable.
      

3.0.6 Released 08/06/2002
      * Fixed intermittent NPE due to null event being fired to 
        RSTablePanel.
      * Fixed 'unknown database' in forward results as email.
      * Fixed execute update to ignore the ';' char at the end of sql.
      * Re-instated command line connection code... Now that 3.x  
        supports a background connection thread.  Interesting to note
	that this single feature was the initial driver behind the entire
	3.x GUI model re-write.  This was required for the click-and-connect
	feature for Java Web Start based deployment.
      * Fixed bug causing all open results tabs not to be closed on 
        disconnect.

3.0.5 Released 5/21/2002
      Bugs: 
      * Fixed potential NPE in DBUtils!  Thanks Todd.

3.0.4 Released 5/21/2002
      Features: 
      * Added LOB support as an option, under Preferences->Data Retrieval
      * Added ABS Max row size.  This is important for MySQL, as if you
        do a select * from a large table, it will attempt to pull the 
	whole thing (under Mark Matthew's JDBC driver).
      Bugs:
      * Fixed connector menu 'Why is my connector disabled?'
      * Fixed execute selected sql.

3.0.3 Released 5/4/2002
      Features:
      * Created inital plugin architecture.  This will allow coding
        modules that are specific to databases or drivers.  Such as
	a user manager for postgres or mysql, or a trigger editor for Oracle.
      * reworking some icons.  This will likely take a couple releases
        because I hate doing these little graphics.
      * Disabling gui elements that require a connection while it is in use.
      Bugs:
      * removing results windows when a query fails due to SQLExcpetion
      * Turned off mouseover for disabled buttons.
      * Added a label to namepattern.
      * Centered lower status text.
      * Setting status text to database name while idle.
      * fixed auto/normal size columns bug.

3.0.2 Released 5/2/2002
      * Limited UPA to superuser.

3.0.1 Released 5/2/2002	
      * Inital beta release of the 3.0 functionality. 3.x delta is 
        measured from this baseline.

3.0.0b1 Unreleased
      * Working copy, massive refactoring of packages and internal
        data structures.

2.8.3 Unreleased
      * Still working with Fred Hart on java.sql.Clob
      * Rollover buttons
      * Changed Core, BuildID, and IconFactory to use their current 
        classes' classloader to load resources, rather than the 
	system classloader.  This is important for Java Web Start
	functionality.
      Bugs
      * Fixed tab pane titles where there was no where clause but 
        there was a group by and/or order by.

2.8.2 Released 03/30/2002

        primary key information is not available for a table when editing.
      Bugs:
      * Fixed row removal on data editor.delete(). Paging interface does
        not include headers in row count.
      * Fixed unlikely null pointer in sql table expansion for treeview.

      * Added windows style ctrl c, x, v to the editor pane
      * Tweaked JBuilder integration to prevent shutdown hangups.  ComboBox
        UI is still screwed up, but it is not a JBuilder specific issue.

      * Changed icons for email, xml, html, and csv exports.
      * Added xml export.
      * Fixed a serious bug introduced in 2.7.6 which broke all of the
        result set export functionality.
      * JBuilder integration.  Copy databrowser.jar into <jbuilder>/lib/ext
        to integrate DB with JB.  Tested with JBuilder 5 and 6 beta.
      * Tweak to configuration wizard run rule

2.7.8 Released 10/20/2001
      * Added initial configuration wizard to help first time users

        provides _real_ syntax highlighting.
      * Updated the DriverLoader to DriverManager
        * Changed from custom class loader to a the java.net.URLClassLoader, 
	  with a wrapper.
	* Added a drivers directory.  This will become useful if future
          versions of the installer come bundled with some JDBC drivers.
	  It works similar to the jre/ext directory.
      * Some Help files are still missing: 
        * Preferences help
	* Classpath help
	* import/export help.  
	These files are in the pipeline.

2.7.3 Released 9/3/01
      * Fixed several minor UI bugs reported by Todd Delaune.  Still working
        on a couple of them.

        errors in the mysql-odbc driver pointed out by justin@blowouts.co.uk.
      * updated some exception handling in TreePanel.

2.7 Unreleased
      * Changed distributed JRE from SUN 1.2.2_007 to SUN 1.3.1.  This
        only applies to Windows users who download an installer with a
	bundled VM.  DataBrowser will continue to work under the 1.2.2 
	JRE for the forseeable future.

      * Added code for multi-line editing in DataEditor.
      * Changed default type in table editor to VARCHAR
      * Made max col width in RSTablePanel 80.
      * Added icons for each supported database in both the connector and

        disabled JLabels.   Values updated in the DataEditor are updated
	in the UI in Blue.
      * DataEditor should now be bug free and ready to go.
      * SchemaUtil now supports date conversion for MySQL.
      
      * Put some code being executed on swing objects into the 
        AWT event queue.  This will prevent random deadlocks. 

2.7 b1 Released 7/31/01
      This is a semi-major version upgrade.  The two key features are:
      1) Single (default) or multiple window operation
      2) Data insert/update/delete capabilities.

      These features are currently in a beta state.
      
      Other upgrades:
      * A number of icon improvements.
      * Changed Preferences to a modal dialog.
      * Log window should scroll to visible.
      * Added Show Connection Code so you can copy/paste the necessary java
        code for connection to the database.
      * SQLExceptionDebugger now shows SQL if it is available.

2.3.5 Unreleased. Completed 6/24/01
      Changed the display icon on the results windows to a table from a
      database icon.  Changed Icon on table editor to table with a pen. 
      This makes it easier to navigate the multiple open windows with 
      the task bar.

      Removed the Core environment initialization stuff, and changed log
      to use the java.io.File.getTempFile() call instead of the hack 
      that was being used.  This should speed startup because we don't 
      need to spawn that process.

2.3.3 Released 6/5/01
      Bugs: 
      * Fixed the password -> default_password migration path
      * Changed the min size of the editor pane to be 4x the height of
      one row.   

      Features:
      Updated the splash screen, help about.
      Updated End-User License Agreement

2.3.3b2 Released 5/20/01
      Bugs: Fixed refreshed query table model. 

      Features: 
      * Added code for auto resizing of the result window column 
      widths.

2.3.3b1 Released 5/11/01
      Features: 
      * Added support for password encryption of passwords in the 
      properties file

      Bugs:
      * Fixed bug in the driver class loader preventing loading of 
      Resource Bundles.  This was causeing NullPointerException for ANY
      SQLException under pgsql, because the ResourceBundle was null.

2.3.2 Released 4/19/01
      * Added support for PostgreSQL 6.5 and 7.0.  The driver class name
      changed from postgresql.Driver to org.postgresql.Driver.  
      * Updated the refresh query function to display the new RxC data.

2.3.1 Released 3/15/01
     The only major change between 2.3b1 and 2.3.1 is several performance
     and memory improvements based on an OptimizeIT demo, and conversations
     with Rob Henry regarding swing frame disposal.
     
     Memory: Memory usage should be much more efficient, because past versions
     were not garbage collecting result set windows when they were closed.
     
     CPU: 
     * Startup should be ~30% faster (JDK 1.3 on Win2k) due to lazy 
       initialization of QuickHelp GUI component
     * App should be quicker overall because of a StringBuffer optimization
       in the low level logging mechanism that was eating lots of CPU.

     Also, the packaging of all com.jet.* code was changed to eliminate
     distribution of non-essential class files with any given project.
     The jet_all.jar still exists, however not for public distribution.  This
     reduces the size of the new jar (databrowser.jar) from ~700k to
     ~500k.

2.3 beta 1  Released 3/3/01 with new web site
     This version contained numerous small improvements and fixes since
     the 5/30/00 release of 2.1.  There had been 7 individual patch releases
     distributed to various users in that time.

     Features:
     * InstantDB Connector
     * PostgreSQL Connector
     * Disconnect menu item on the file menu
     * App now remembers the state of combo boxes for treeview from
       session to session.
     
     Bug Fixes:
     * Data import and export upgrades.
     * session properties are now written more often, and NOT written
       at shutdown.  This should prevent people from losing their	
       session information.

2.1.1 Working version.  

     Features: 
     * Quick Help
     * Driver class loader

     Bug Fixes: 
     * Null pointer on linux/unix startup.

2.1  RC 1 First DataManager release.  Released 5/30/00
     First pre-release for 2.1.  2.0.3 was a development release, not 
     publicly available.  The import/export part of this release is weak,
     but I want to get out the bug fixes, enhancements, and MySQL support.

     Features: 
     * Added configurable property to turn syntax highlighting on and off.
       The syntax highlighter is not very efficient right now, especially for
       large or multiple statements.
     * Cleaned up some of the more "beta" features
     * Added classpath display gui.
     * Added gui for deleting bookmarks.
     * Added "deadly" features when right clicking on table view --
       Delete all rows and Drop table.  USE AT YOUR PERIL.

     Bug Fixes:
     * Increased max recent connections to 20 from 10 at the behest of 
       Todd Delaune
     * No longer erasing history when opening a new connection.

2.0.3  beta
       Beta release, gradually adding features for data manager.

       Features:
       * New connector for MySQL (Mark Mathews Driver)
       * File menu options to save and open SQL
       * Adding new features for DataManager
         * Vast improvements to table editor, combo for types, check 
           boxes for booleans, etc.
         * Initial work on data import/export
         * Adding batch execute to execute multiple commands in the editor window

       Bug Fixes:
       * Fixed bugs in table sorting and copying

2.0.1  Released Feb 27, 2000
       Bug fix release driven primarily by response to user input.
       Thanks: Charlie Kotan, Thomas Gunzelmann

       Features:
       * Added a connector for DB2 net database connections

       Bug Fixes:
       * Changed from EPropertes to Properties for connections because
         DB2 Driver enumerates and casts to string
       * Changed Preferences validation so that if you don't have a 
         tnsnames.ora, or odbc.ini the preferences will still function
       * Fixed bug in Core that prevented startup on OS/2 systems.

2.0  Released Feb 14, 2000
     Major improvements in stability and support for multiple databases and
     multiple VMs.  

     Features: 
     * SplitPane Main window
     * Support for 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 VMs
     * Icon improvements in treeview
     * ResultSet window improvement: save as html, csv; send as email

     Bug Fixes:
     * Fixed Oracle Thin connector. Oracle has a bug in their thin
       JDBC Driver

1.0.1 Released N/A
  I Don't think this was ever released.

  Features Added:
    * Added status bar to results window.  Status bar shows row and column
      count, and query elapsed time.

  Bugs:
    * Added references from MainWin to License to prevent
      class gc when the noclassgc parm is not passed in.  This
      was causing licensing info to be lost.
    * Added maxRows to QueryThread for long data views.  This prevents
      OutOfMemory errors on some drivers.

1.0  Released Dec 23, 1999
     Initial production relase

     Features:
     * Initial production release
